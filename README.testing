The test framework is a bit weak so far, but it has caught some
regressions so it's already been worth the effort.

Some of the tests use a local Rietveld server.
To set this up:
1) Check out a copy of Rietveld:
   $ svn checkout http://rietveld.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ rietveld-read-only
   (Use git-svn if you must, but man is it slow.)
2) Get the Google App Engine SDK:
   http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html

Run Rietveld:
/path/to/appengine/sdk/dev_appserver.py /path/to/rietveld
(If using one of the App Engine launchers, be sure to use port 8080
 for this project.)

To run Rietveld you will need Django 1.0 which is not included with
the App Engine SDK.  Go to http://www.djangoproject.com/download,
download Django-1.0.4.tar.gz, then "sudo python setup.py install".

And then, finally, run the tests.
